## 🔐 Risk & Capital Protection

**Purpose:**  
This page evaluates downside exposure, volatility regimes, and loss concentration across crypto assets.  
It is designed to identify tail-risk events and capital preservation threats rather than frequent market behavior.

---

### 📌 Key Questions Answered
- Are there any assets currently in a high-risk drawdown state?
- How severe is the worst historical drawdown?
- Is the market operating under high or low volatility conditions?
- How often do high-risk regimes actually occur?

---

### 📊 Visual Components

#### 1️⃣ Market Volatility Regime (KPI)
Classifies the current market environment as **Low Volatility** or **High Volatility** based on rolling volatility thresholds.

- Used to contextualize drawdowns
- Not a timing signal

---

#### 2️⃣ Worst Drawdown % (KPI)
Displays the **maximum peak-to-trough loss** observed within the selected period and assets.

- Represents tail risk
- Drives capital protection decisions

---

#### 3️⃣ Risk State (KPI)
Binary risk indicator:
- **High Risk** → At least one asset breaches severe drawdown or volatility thresholds
- **Low Risk** → No extreme risk conditions detected

> This KPI reflects the *existence* of risk, not its frequency.

---

#### 4️⃣ Drawdown Ranking (Bar Chart)
Ranks assets by their worst drawdown percentage.

- Highlights loss concentration
- Enables rapid identification of capital-destructive assets
- Color-coded by severity

---

#### 5️⃣ Risk Distribution (Donut Chart)
Shows the **frequency of risk states across all observations**.

- Provides context on how common high-risk regimes are
- Complements the Risk State KPI
- Explains why markets can appear stable despite extreme tail events

---

### ⚠️ Design Philosophy
- KPIs prioritize **risk detection**
- Charts provide **risk context**
- Extreme events are intentionally emphasized
- Frequency ≠ Severity

---

### 🧠 Interpretation Guidance
> Markets are often calm, but losses are driven by rare, extreme events.  
This page exists to surface those events early and clearly.
